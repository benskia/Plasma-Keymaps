# KDE Plasma Keymaps

Most notable are vim-like (hjkl) mappings for window snapping and swapping.

## Window Control
* Meta-[hjkl] to snap windows left, down, up, and right. A quick combination
(ex: C-hj) will snap the window into a corner (ex: bottom-left).
* Meta-Control-[hjkl] to change active window.
* Meta-Shift-[hl] to move the active window to the left or right monitor.
* Meta-Shift-[jk] to minimize or maximize the active window.

## Plasma Apps
* Meta-Shift-x for system settings.
* Meta-Shift-s for Spectacle: capture rectangular area.

## Third-Party Apps
* Meta-Enter opens Kitty Terminal
